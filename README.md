# Portfolio

This section highlights a diverse array of projects that I have developed or contributed to, showcasing my skills across different technologies and problem domains. Each project listed here represents a unique challenge or a practical solution designed to address real-world issues. These projects cover various aspects of software engineering, including cybersecurity, store management systems, and machine learning, and are implemented in multiple programming languages to demonstrate versatility and depth of knowledge.

## GCP Cybersecurity 
In this capstone project, I executed a comprehensive cybersecurity simulation on Google Cloud Platform, demonstrating my ability to respond to and mitigate cyber attacks effectively.

## Store system
This proof of concept for a store management system showcases my ability to develop scalable and robust applications using a variety of programming languages. Each version is tailored to demonstrate specific language strengths and integration capabilities:

In different Languages: [C#](https://github.com/mid-tillage/sys-internals/blob/main/store-cs-project.md), [Go](https://github.com/mid-tillage/sys-internals/blob/main/store-go-project.md), [Java](https://github.com/mid-tillage/sys-internals/blob/main/store-java-project.md), [Python](https://github.com/mid-tillage/sys-internals/blob/main/store-python-project.md), [Ruby](https://github.com/mid-tillage/sys-internals/blob/main/store-ruby-project.md), [Rust](https://github.com/mid-tillage/sys-internals/blob/main/store-rust-project.md), ~~[PHP](https://github.com/mid-tillage/sys-internals/blob/main/store-php-project.md)~~, [Typescript](https://github.com/mid-tillage/sys-internals/blob/main/store-ts-project.md)

Monitoring: [Prometheus and Grafana](https://github.com/mid-tillage/nestjs-metrics)

## ML/AI
This section highlights my engagement with machine learning and artificial intelligence through practical exercises featured in an online tutorial series. The exercises cover a range of fundamental and advanced topics, including data preprocessing, model building, and deployment using popular frameworks and libraries in Python. The comprehensive collection of code snippets and detailed explanations demonstrate my grasp on AI concepts and my ability to apply them in real-world scenarios.
